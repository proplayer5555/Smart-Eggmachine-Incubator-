# Smart Egg Incubator System

Welcome to the Smart Egg Incubator System repository! This project focuses on creating an embedded system for egg incubation, combining hardware components such as the ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors with software functionalities to monitor and control the incubation process. The system also includes a live website interface for remote monitoring and notification alerts to ensure optimal conditions for egg hatching.

## Overview

The Smart Egg Incubator System integrates hardware and software components to create an intelligent egg incubation solution. The hardware setup includes the ESP32 microcontroller, temperature and humidity sensors, and other necessary components for monitoring environmental conditions inside the incubator. The software comprises firmware running on the ESP32, a backend server for data processing and storage, and a web-based user interface for remote monitoring and control.

## Features

### 1. Environmental Monitoring

The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity levels inside the incubator using sensors connected to the ESP32 microcontroller. Real-time data is collected and processed to ensure optimal conditions for egg incubation.

### 2. Automatic Control

Based on environmental data, the system automatically adjusts parameters such as temperature and humidity to maintain optimal conditions for egg hatching. Control algorithms implemented in the firmware regulate heating, cooling, and humidity levels as needed.

### 3. Web Interface

The system provides a web-based user interface accessible via a live website. Users can remotely monitor incubator conditions, view real-time sensor data, and receive notifications about important events such as temperature fluctuations or hatching alerts.

### 4. Notification Alerts

The system sends notification alerts to users via email or SMS in case of critical events or abnormal conditions detected during the incubation process. Notifications help users take timely actions to address issues and ensure successful egg hatching.

### 5. Data Logging and Analysis

The system logs environmental data collected from the sensors, allowing users to track historical trends and analyze incubation performance over time. Data visualization tools may be integrated into the web interface for easy analysis and decision-making.

## Usage

To use the Smart Egg Incubator System, follow these steps:

1. Set up the hardware components according to the provided schematics and wiring diagrams.

2. Flash the firmware onto the ESP32 microcontroller, ensuring proper configuration of sensor connections and control algorithms.

3. Deploy the backend server for data processing and storage, ensuring compatibility with the ESP32 firmware for seamless communication.

4. Set up the live website interface for remote monitoring, including user authentication and access control features.

5. Configure notification alerts to send email or SMS notifications to designated recipients based on predefined triggers and thresholds.

6. Monitor incubator conditions remotely using the web interface, and respond to notifications promptly to ensure successful egg hatching.
